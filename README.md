uchroot
=======

chroot without root priviledge, with the help of user namespace.

**Note**: this is pretty such a toy right now, don't use for important things.

## Build

You need one of the [D compilers](https://dlang.org/download.html). And simply
compile `main.d`.

## Usage

``` bash
./main new_root
```
